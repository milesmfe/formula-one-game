# A BRIEF IDEA OF THE GAME

(1) 

Formula One is different from all games in that the dice are not used for moving the cars in any way, but merely for deciding penalties.

(2) 

The length of the race is optional, but a minimum of 3 laps must be raced for all the factors in the game to take effect.

(3) 

One space on the board represents 20 m.p.h. on the speedometer, so that if a player has 100 m.p.h. on his speedometer he moves his car 5 squares.

A driver may vary his speed from turn to turn, but he may never increase speed by more than 60 m.p.h. per turn, and when reducing his speed he must pay any penalty demanded by the "Speed Reduction Chart."

At the beginning of the race it usually pays a driver to accelerate up to 60 m.p.h. in his first turn, and so move 3 squares. Then in his next turn he can, if he so wishes, speed up to 120 m.p.h. and move 6 squares. He will then have to judge his speed according to the approaching corner, and the risks he wishes to take at it.

(4) 

The speed written on the red band of each corner is the "safety speed", and no penalty can be given to a car which negotiates a corner at this speed.

However it is possible to take a corner at 20 m.p.h. or 10 m.p.h. over the safety speed. If a player does this he shakes both dice to see what penalty (if any) he has incurred, as shown on the "Penalty Chart" on the board.

A driver is more likely to be penalised for crossing the red band at 40 over than 20 over. If he crosses at 60 m.p.h. over the safety speed, he automatically spins off.

# RULES

## THE START

### ORDER OF MOVING

Ist AWAY-Yellow; 2nd AWAY-Orange; 3rd AWAY-Green;4th AWAY-Red; 5th AWAY-Black; LAST AWAY-Blue.

- Place each car on its respective square on the starting grid.
- The pit cards should be shuffled and placed face down on the space provided on the board.
- The tactic cards are shuffled and dealt, each player receiving 5 cards.

The choice of cars is decided by throwing the dice, the player obtaining the highest number takes number 1, then the player on his left takes number 2, and so on. All the players then take their own dash-board lay-out.

Set the lap indicator to the number of laps you wish to race, and set all other instruments at zero.

The dice are not used for moving and are put aside until required for deciding penalties.

## MOVING

One square on the board represents 20 miles per hour.

- Speed may be increased by 20, 40 or 60 m.p.h. per turn but never by more than 60 m.p.h.
- If 20 m.p.h. is set on the speedometer—move car 1 square on board.
- If 40 m.p.h. is set on the speedometer—move car 2 squares on board.
- If 60 m.p.h. is set on the speedometer—move car 3 squares on board.
- If 80 m.p.h. is set on the speedometer—move car 4 squares on board, etc.

Only one car is allowed on one square at a time. No car may "jump over" another.

## DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT

Movement is always in a forward direction; straight ahead or diagonally, but never sideways.

## CORNER HAZARDS (Red Bands)

Corners can be taken safely and without penalty provided that the speeds shown on the red bands are not exceeded.

...but races are not won by this policy, it may pay the driver to corner at excess speed and risk a penalty.

- When a car has been moved the full number of squares shown on the speedometer, and has passed over or come to rest on a red band and has exceeded the safety speed shown, the dice must be thrown.
- Dependent on the number thrown, there is the possibility of paying the penalty of tyre wear, brake wear or spinning off.

The penalties are listed on the penalty chart printed on the board. The faster a corner is taken over the red bands, the greater the risk of harsher penalties and a car taking a corner at 60 m.p.h. or more above safety speeds, automatically spins off the track.

When a car crosses two red bands over the safety speed during the course of one move, the dice must be thrown and the possible penalty paid separately for each band.

## SPINNING OFF

A car always spins off in the following circumstances:

(1) When a red corner band is crossed at a speed in excess of 40 m.p.h. above the safety speed.

---

(2) ﻿﻿﻿﻿When a speed reduction of over 20 m.p.h. is demanded and there are no brakes left.

(3) ﻿﻿﻿﻿When a red corner band is crossed at any speed over the safety speed, and the tyre wear gauge is at its maximum of 8.

Spinning off can also occur—as a result of the dice throw—as shown on the Penalty Chart.

- When a car spins off whilst taking a corner, it is placed on the Spin Off Point.
- When a car spins off as a result of being baulked, and being forced to brake too hard (see Baulking) it is placed on the outside of the track opposite the point at which it is standing.
- When a car spins off, the speedometer is reduced to zero but the tyre wear and brake wear gauges are never altered.

No damage is done by spinning off, and on the next turn the car can proceed normally, at the starting speed of 60 m.p.h.

## REDUCTION IN SPEED

Due to the hazards at various points on the track, the need to slow down arises. This entails the use of gears and when necessary, brakes. Harsh braking results in wear and tear of the brakes and tyres.

- A 20 m.p.h. reduction in speed does not result in any brake or tyre wear.
- Moderate use of brakes results only in brake wear.
- Harsher braking results in brake and tyre wear.

---

When a driver reduces speed all such brake and tyre wear must be indicated on the dials provided.

As the game progresses, tyre wear may become excessive and reach its maximum of 8 points. In which case, speed may be reduced by 40 m.p.h. only.

## LAP INDICATOR

The lap indicator on the steering column acts merely as a record of laps travelled.

When the chequered line is crossed at the end of each lap the indicator is reduced by one point.

The indicator is set at the beginning of the race to the number of laps you wish to race, so that it reaches zero at the end.

## BAULKING

Baulking, or blocking the road to other drivers is to your own advantage, since it prevents their overtaking.

This can usually be brought about where the track is narrowed by the black corner islands, or Prenton Pool.

- A baulked car may be moved forward as many spaces as possible to the space immediately behind the baulking car.
- If the car baulking you is travelling at a lower speed than your own car you must reduce the speed on your speedometer to equal that of the car in front. Any penalty of brake or tyre wear must be indicated on your dials immediately (see Speed Reduction Chart).
- If it is travelling at a faster speed than your car you may, if you wish, increase speed to that of the baulking car, providing the increase is not more than 60 m.p.h., even though you cannot move the correct number of spaces.
- If a car is baulked in the pit or in a spin off point, he may bring his speedometer up to 60 m.p.h., although he may be unable to move, and in his next turn he can move off at any speed up to 120 m.p.h.

---

*Example*: In the diagram, the white car moves at 60 m.p.h. in front of the black, thus preventing him moving and forcing him to reduce his speed to 60 m.p.h.

## PITS AND PIT CARDS

At the end of any lap a driver may drive into his pit. Pit stops enable the driver to have his tyres changed, his brakes adjusted, and any repairs made so that he can continue the race with his car in perfect condition.

- When approaching the pits, the driver must set his speedometer so that by moving the indicated number of squares his car can be brought exactly to its own pit stop.
- If a player misjudges his speed, and overshoots his pit square, he must continue the new lap, as no reversing or sideways movement is allowed.
- Once in the pits, all dials, except the lap indicator, are re-set at zero.
- When calling at the pits a player must always draw a pit card, and follow its instructions before moving off again.
- The card must be replaced at the bottom of the pack.

Pit stop squares do not form part of the normal track, and a player may only drive on his own pit square.

---

## TACTIC CARDS

At the beginning of the game the tactic cards are shuffled and each driver is dealt five from the pack.

These cards, which provide extra moves, can be used to a car's advantage whenever the driver wishes, except when he has spun off.

- The used card is placed face down on the Tactic Card space marked on the board and may not be used again.
- With one exception, Tactic Cards must always be played immediately after a normal move has been made, but before shaking the two dice if a corner has been taken.
- The exception is the "Superb Driving" card which is played before the normal move is made and enables a driver, in his normal move, to take a corner at maximum speed without incurring any penalty.
- Only one tactic card may be used per turn.

## FINISHING AND WINNING

When a car lands on or crosses the chequered finishing line after completing the set number of laps he has finished.

However, he has not necessarily won, for all cars must have the same number of turns (to avoid number one having an unfair advantage), so the play continues until the last player has played his turn, the car which is then furthest over the chequered line is the winner.

## NOTE

The game can be made more interesting by having a **LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP** of several races with:

- 10 points for the winner
- 8 points for second place
- 6 points for third place
- 4 points for fourth place
- 2 points for fifth place
- 1 point for sixth place

(over 5 laps; the Champion Driver being the one who earns the highest number of points from all the races).
